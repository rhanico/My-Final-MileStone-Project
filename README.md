## About

The Grocery Run is a web browser game inspired by the Google Dino Run. In this game, you control a character and your objective is to avoid obstacles, including "Angry Old Ladies," by jumping and performing small jumps. The game keeps track of your score, which increases the longer you survive. The game ends if your character collides with any obstacles. To restart the game, simply click the main logo.

**For the best user experience, play on a desktop with full-screen mode.**
