# My-Final-MileStone-Project - THE GROCERY RUN!
This is my submission for my 1st Milestone Project- WEB BROWSER game with HTML/ CSS /JavaScript


ABOUT:

  This game is isnpired by Google Dino Run web browser game and I also took the inspiration for the theme from my first job as a Cashier in a grocery store. The mechanics of this game is simple, avoid the "Boxes" that are coming towards you, especially  "Angry Old Ladies" by simply "JUMPING' by pressing the "SPACE BAR" and for a "SMALL JUMP" boost, press "RIGHT ARROW" key on your keyboard.
 
  There will be a counter located in the top right corner of the screen that will monitor your score. The longer you run, the highher your score will be and the game will stop if your character collide to any of the obstacles. 
  
  To restart the game, simply click the main logo " The Grocery Run! ".
  
  
  FOR BEST USER EXPERIENCE, USE DESKTOP WITH FULL SCREEN.
